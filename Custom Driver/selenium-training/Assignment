Question 1:
Implement custom WebDriver classes for Firefox and Edge based on the operating system to complement the existing Chrome WebDriver.
Ensure they support core functionalities like launching the browser, navigation, and element interaction, and integrate them into
the current testing framework with comprehensive test cases and documentation.


Question 2:
Implement a Selenium WebDriver script that utilizes Java Streams to extract and filter text from web elements (e.g., links) on a webpage.
The script should demonstrate the use of map and filter to transform and collect the data, showcasing efficient data handling in a web automation context.


Question 3:
Create a utility class similar to CSVReader that reads locators from an Excel sheet.
The script should retrieve locators based on specified actions and platforms, ensuring it handles different data formats and integrates
Apache POI or a similar library for Excel file manipulation.
